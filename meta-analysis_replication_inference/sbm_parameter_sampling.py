#Remember to beware of Neal's Funnel. https://mc-stan.org/docs/2_18/stan-users-guide/reparameterization-section.html. parameter_value = parameter_raw * N(0,1). parameter_value is not directly sampled, but is obtained after multiplying a raw scaling factor, parameter_raw, by normal distribution draw. parameter_value is then passed to static parameter value calculation and SDE solving functions.
